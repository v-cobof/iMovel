## About the Project 📘

It's the landing page for a ficticious Real Estate Company called iMovel. The design and code was teached by the instructor Matheus Battisti, from the Hora de Codar YouTube channel.

The objective is to display all the qualities and best works from iMovel, using images obtained in <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a>, and other free image sources.

I went through the proccess of developing this website especially to learn more about Bootstrap 5, and responsive design.

The website was deployed in Github pages, and can be visualized <a href="https://v-cobof.github.io/iMovel/#">here</a>. Only the Home page was developed.

## How to run the app 🚀

### Frontend

Because I used Bootstrap through CDN, to run this app in your machine, you'll just need to clone the repo with command below, and open the index.html file. 

```bash
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/v-cobof/dsvendas-sds4.git
```
